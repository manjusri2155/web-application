This web page provides a Soil Suitability & Quality Analysis tool that allows users to input various soil parameters such as pH, moisture percentage, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, and the proportions of clay, silt, and sand in the soil. When the user submits the form, the code first validates that the total percentage of clay, silt, and sand equals 100%, ensuring the soil texture data is consistent. It then evaluates each parameter against its ideal range using a scoring function that calculates a weighted score based on how close the input values are to the ideal ranges. The soil texture is classified simply as Clay, Sandy, or Loamy based on the clay and sand percentages, which also contributes to the overall score. The final soil quality percentage is calculated by summing all weighted scores and comparing it to the maximum possible score. Based on this overall percentage, the soil is classified as Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor quality, and the suitability for planting is determined. The detailed results, including individual parameter scores and the final assessment, are displayed clearly for the user to understand the soil condition.
